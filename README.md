This repository will contain your own front-end project on React with added authorization and registration features.
Use your previously built front end from Sprint 11, or front end together with the back end you've built in sprints 12 and 13. 

All authorization, registration and token requests must go through to the server running on https://register.nomoreparties.co. Other requests which are not specified in this project may be connected  to either this back end server, or the one you have been building.

Good luck!
