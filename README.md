### Overview
This project adds to the foundations of my previous React application. This version includes routes for signing
in and signing up, and is temporarily connected to an externally run server for user authentication. In the next
project, I will connect to my own custom API. 

### Techniques
I utilized many of the primary features of React in this application. I used React routes to direct unregistered
users to the login page and a protected route, a higher-order component, to secure the main page content. Once 
logged in, the app stores a JWT so that users don't have to log in again when revisiting/reloading. I designed a 
variety of Functional and Class components to get used to using state, methods, and handlers in both types. 
Navigation is handled with ReactRouter via Link components, Redirect components, and the push() method of the 
history object.

### Technologies
