[View this project here!](https://william-schutte.github.io/react-around-auth/)

### Overview
This project adds to the foundations of my previous React application. This version includes routes for signing
in and signing up, and is temporarily connected to an externally run server for user authentication. In the next
project, I will connect to my own custom API. 


### Techniques
This page stores a JWT to keep users logged in. It uses ReactRouter for navigation as well as state management
and higher-order components to protect routes and redirect users.

### Technologies
* React
* NPM
* JS/JSX/HTML/CSS
* Git/GitHub
* Visual Studio Code
* Figma

-----

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
